This is simply my standard blank HTML5 Wordpress theme. I use it as a jumping-off point for my
projects. It is based heavily on the "Blank" theme by Chris Coyier (it can be found at digwp.com).
The original theme is HTML4, so I HTML5'd it up and am adding a couple of stuff such as:
- four widget areas in convenient places for me: Header, Nav (for WP3 menu), Sidebar, Footer
- WP3 menus (create your menus and add as widgets within WP)
- a bunch of stuff in the functions.php file
- my very specific, and probably wrong, HTML5 document structure. If you think it is wrong, (for
  example, I don't think that I'm using <aside> correctly), let me know. A good thing, though - I am
  not using a wrapper div. The .body class works just fine for that in most cases.
